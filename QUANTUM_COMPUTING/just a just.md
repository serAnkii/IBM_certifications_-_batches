Q===Now imagine that, in order to save the world, you need to decrypt a secret message by factoring a number that’s … oh … 10,000 digits long. (This is a real scale for a decryption problem.)
The message is so important that your government has given you access to the fastest supercomputer in the world!
what would you do huh?
































































































answer==You write a brilliant program that breaks the message’s number into prime factors, then tests each group of factors until it finds the combination that can unlock the secret code. (This is how a conventional computer would try to solve the problem.)

but 

Now you run the program and wait.

You go out for lunch.

You return to find that the computer is still processing the program.

You come back the next morning and find the same thing.

Eventually your program solves the problem ...

ohh heck shit man what to do to solve the problem real fu@#$%ing quick

To find the the answer of the answer (lol!) quantum computimg will come into the play.
