## Step 1: Hypothesis
> ### Q1 = Which is your prediction how the experiment will turn out. In this case, knowing that it takes 3 transistors to express the number 7 in binary, you predict that expressing the number 17 in binary will require…

## Ans= still just 3 transistors
> ### Hmm. It turns out that 17 in binary is written as 10001. So it takes 5 transistors to express it, even though you could type it on a keyboard in 2 strokes.

## Q2 :Now imagine that, in order to save the world, you need to decrypt a secret message by factoring a number that’s … oh … 10,000 digits long. (This is a real scale for a decryption problem.) The message is so important that your government has given you access to the fastest supercomputer in the world! what would you do huh?

## answer:-

- You write a brilliant program that breaks the message’s number into prime factors, then tests each group of factors until it finds the combination that can unlock the secret code. (This is how a conventional computer would try to solve the problem.)

but

- Now you run the program and wait.

- You go out for lunch.

- You return to find that the computer is still processing the program.

- You come back the next morning and find the same thing.

- Eventually your program solves the problem ...

- ohh heck ,shit man what to do to solve the problem real fu@#$%ing quick

## Q3:There’s a famous saying: “A = A” How would you interpret this?

> - a = each letter of the alphabet has its own identity.
> - b = a thing can't have contradictory properties.
> - c = the simplest explanation for something is most likely true.

### Ans = the correct one is b
> Explanation
> we’ll interpret A = A as meaning that one thing cannot have two opposite properties at the same time. For example, it can’t rotate right and rotate left at the same time.
